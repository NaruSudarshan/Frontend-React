# Context API

- need of context api
  - when we have to pass data from one component to another component which is far away in the component tree
  - we have to use props drilling (passing props from parent to child and so on)
  - it becomes difficult to manage and maintain the code
  - to avoid props drilling we use context api

- redux is also used to manage state globally but it is a third party library and it is complex to use

- redux-toolkit is a simplified version of redux and it is easy to use

- react-redux is a library that connects react with redux

# more on context api

- context api can be used at any stage of project
